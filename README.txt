This script was created as a programming exercise and is EXTREMELY beta. This script accepts a starting and ending mileage range. It allows you to choose how many months this mileage was accrued within. You can also specify how many trips you generally make during any given month.

Based on the values you supply, this script will generate a random number of odometer readings for a random number of trips for each of the month that you've specified. The odometer readings are purposely non-sequential.

Known Bugs:
Finale mileage does not exactly match the ending mileage specified. This appears to be due to the random nature of the integers.
